# WDD 430 – Web Full-Stack Development

This repository contains my coursework and hands-on practice for **WDD 430: Web Full-Stack Development**.

The focus of this course is building modern full-stack web applications using industry-standard tools and documentation, with an emphasis
on practical implementation rather than theory alone.

## What I’m Working On

Throughout this course, I am developing skills in:

- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- React fundamentals and component-based architecture
- State management and data flow with props
- Server-side development concepts
- Databases and APIs
- Deployment workflows and cloud platforms
- Collaborative development using Git and GitHub

The course relies heavily on official documentation (such as **nextjs.org**) and mirrors how developers learn and adapt to new technologies
in real-world environments.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by learning modules and topics. Each directory includes code examples, small exercises, and notes created while 
working through the course material.

Examples include:
- React Foundations (Next.js tutorials)
- JavaScript essentials for React
- Component design with props and state
- Additional practice and experiments

## Tools & Technologies

- JavaScript
- React
- Next.js
- Node.js
- Git & GitHub
- Vercel

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A record of my learning and progress
- A place to experiment and practice full-stack concepts
- A reference I can continue improving beyond the course
